### No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) Report

Welcome to the comprehensive report on No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). This document delves into the state-of-the-art techniques, methodologies, and findings in the field of NR-IQA, with a particular focus on the latest advancements and challenges associated with evaluating the perceptual quality of images without a reference.

#### Key Highlights:

- **Overview of NR-IQA**:
  Understand the fundamental concepts and importance of NR-IQA in various applications, including multimedia, surveillance, and medical imaging.

- **Challenges with GAN-Based Distortion**:
  Explore the unique challenges posed by GAN-based distortion images, which exhibit unreal textures that satisfy human perception but deviate from deep-learning models' prior knowledge.

- **Multi-dimension Attention Network for NR-IQA (MANIQA)**:
  Learn about the innovative MANIQA model, which leverages the Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract features and incorporates Transposed Attention Blocks (TAB) and Scale Swin Transformer Blocks (SSTB) to enhance global and local interactions, respectively. This dual-branch structure significantly improves patch-weighted quality prediction.

- **Performance Evaluation**:
  Discover how MANIQA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets such as PIPAL, LIVE, CSIQ, TID2013, and KADID-10K, and ranked first in the NTIRE 2022 Perceptual Image Quality Assessment Challenge Track 2: No-Reference.

- **Ablation Studies**:
  Insights into the impact of various components of MANIQA, including the ViT feature extractor, TAB, SSTB, and dual-branch structure, in improving evaluation performance.

#### Contents:

- Introduction to NR-IQA
